### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was a bit of a challenge because I was torn on whether I should use grid or flex-box. I eventually settled on grid for the cards and the overview and made them responsive (no need for media queries ðŸŽ‰). Like so:

.testimonials {
margin-top: 40px;
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(350px, 1fr)); this helped the cards and the overview fit in any viewport
align-items: center;
justify-items: center;
grid-gap: .5rem;
grid-auto-flow: dense;
}

### Continued development

This project was a helpful remainder of the things I had forgotten. Like how to use grid layout for responsiveness. And also need to improve on my media queries and do more projects to improve my skills

### Useful resources

- (https://www.css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/) - This helped me with grid responsiveness. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
